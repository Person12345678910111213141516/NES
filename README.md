# NES (New Editing Software), An alternative code editor for Python

## Propaganda
"I really, really want to write Python code quickly without downloading a 1000 yottabyte zip bomb or learning 250 new keybinds," said the young developer. "If only I could find a simple editor that was leightweight but with straightforward commands!"

... Well, that's not this, but that's what this was *supposed* to be.

NES is a code editor. It is relatively small, and has a couple features that would put it just a bit above using Notepad, such as:

- Search for keywords with Regex
- Code highlighting
- Built-in terminal (sort of)
- Colour options
