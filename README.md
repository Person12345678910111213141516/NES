# NES (New Editing Software), An alternative code editor

## Propaganda
"I really, really want to write code quickly without downloading a 1000 yottabyte zip bomb or learning 250 new keybinds," said the young developer. "If only I could find a simple editor that was leightweight but with straightforward commands!"

... Well, that's not this, but that's what this was *supposed* to be.

## Comparison to Benchmarks

In my entirely unbiased opinion, I would place NES slightly above Notepad in terms of functionality and style. However, it's not nearly as good as Vim, and much worse than VSCode.
